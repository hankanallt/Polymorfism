/*
Polymorfism is easy, just have a super class , put the methods there and extend all the other classes to the Super class.

Best way is to also declare the move method in the
super class.
This will give us polymorphism. Meaning we donâ€™t even need to cast to get access to the
subclass implementation of the method.




Add a move() method to the
Animal class.
This method can be abstract or
not.
If sub class has a move() method
the sub class method will be run
else the Animal class move
method will be run.
No cast needed!
This is what is called polymorphism.*/
